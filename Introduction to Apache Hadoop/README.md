## Overview of Hadoop
Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework that enables distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers. It is designed to scale from a single server to thousands of machines, with a high degree of fault tolerance.

## Core Components
1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**: A distributed file system that stores data across multiple nodes.
2. **MapReduce**: A programming model for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm.
3. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: A resource management layer for job scheduling and cluster resource management.


## Getting Started with Hadoop
To get started, you can set up a local Hadoop environment or use cloud-based Hadoop services. This section provides setup instructions, common commands, and sample code for beginner-friendly hands-on practice.
