# Introduction to Apache Hive

This folder provides an introduction to **Apache Hive**, a data warehousing tool that enables easy data querying and analysis on top of Hadoop. Apache Hive simplifies big data processing by providing a SQL-like interface for querying and managing large datasets stored in Hadoop.

## What is Apache Hive?
Apache Hive is a data warehousing and SQL-based query engine built on top of Hadoop. It allows users to perform data analysis on large datasets using a familiar SQL-like syntax, which is converted into MapReduce or Tez jobs that run on the Hadoop cluster.

## Key Features of Hive
- **SQL-Like Interface**: Hive provides a SQL-like language called HiveQL, making it accessible to those familiar with SQL.
- **Scalability**: Supports handling large datasets across a distributed Hadoop environment.
- **Data Storage Compatibility**: Can store data in HDFS and integrates well with other Hadoop ecosystem tools.
- **Extensibility**: Supports custom UDFs (User Defined Functions) for custom data processing.

## Hive Architecture
Hiveâ€™s architecture consists of:
1. **Metastore**: Stores metadata about the tables and schemas.
2. **Driver**: Compiles, optimizes, and executes queries.
3. **Compiler**: Converts SQL-like queries to MapReduce jobs.
4. **Execution Engine**: Manages the execution of jobs.

## Hive Query Language (HQL)
HiveQL is the query language of Hive, similar to SQL. It supports:
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Create, drop, and alter tables.
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Insert, select, and delete data.
- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Perform analytical queries on data.

## Getting Started with Hive
This section includes setup instructions, basic Hive commands, and example queries to help you get started with Hive.
