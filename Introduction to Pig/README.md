# Introduction to Apache Pig

This folder provides an introduction to **Apache Pig**, a high-level platform for processing large data sets in Hadoop. Apache Pig uses a scripting language called Pig Latin, making it easier to analyze and transform large datasets without needing to write complex MapReduce code.

## What is Apache Pig?
Apache Pig is a data processing tool in the Hadoop ecosystem designed to simplify complex data transformations and aggregations. It provides an abstraction over MapReduce and is particularly useful for tasks such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) in large-scale data pipelines.

## Core Features of Pig
- **Ease of Use**: Uses Pig Latin, a scripting language with a syntax similar to SQL, making data processing accessible to users without deep programming knowledge.
- **Extensibility**: Supports User Defined Functions (UDFs) in languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript for custom data processing.
- **Optimization**: Automatically optimizes the execution of Pig scripts for efficiency in the Hadoop environment.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently processes massive datasets on a distributed Hadoop cluster.

## Pig Architecture
1. **Pig Latin Scripts**: Scripts written in Pig Latin are converted into a series of MapReduce jobs.
2. **Parser**: Parses Pig Latin scripts and generates a logical plan.
3. **Optimizer**: Optimizes the logical plan into a physical plan.
4. **Execution Engine**: Executes the physical plan as MapReduce jobs on Hadoop.

## Pig Latin Scripting Language
Pig Latin is a high-level language for data transformation tasks. It supports:
- **Data Loading**: Load data from HDFS or other sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Perform filtering, grouping, joining, and sorting.
- **Data Storage**: Store processed data back in HDFS or export to other formats.

## Getting Started with Pig
This section includes setup instructions, basic Pig commands, and example scripts to help you start working with Pig. Example use cases include data filtering, aggregation, and joining datasets.
