# Introduction to Apache Spark

This folder provides an introduction to **Apache Spark**, an open-source, distributed computing system that is fast, scalable, and designed for big data processing. Apache Spark provides a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing.

## What is Apache Spark?
Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose cluster-computing system that provides an easy-to-use programming model for big data processing. It offers in-memory processing, which makes it much faster than traditional disk-based processing, and can be run on a single machine or across a cluster of computers.

## Core Features of Spark
- **In-Memory Computing**: Spark’s ability to perform in-memory computations significantly boosts performance for iterative algorithms, making it well-suited for machine learning tasks.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Spark provides fault tolerance through its Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) model, which automatically handles data replication and recovery.
- **Speed**: It can process large datasets much faster than Hadoop MapReduce due to its in-memory processing.
- **Unified Framework**: Spark supports batch processing, real-time streaming, machine learning (MLlib), SQL-based querying (Spark SQL), and graph processing (GraphX) within a single framework.
- **Compatibility with Hadoop**: Spark can run on Hadoop YARN, allowing it to leverage Hadoop’s distributed storage (HDFS) and resource management.

## Spark Architecture
Apache Spark consists of the following components:
1. **Driver**: The process that runs the main program and schedules tasks.
2. **Cluster Manager**: Manages resources and job scheduling across the cluster (e.g., YARN, Mesos, or Standalone mode).
3. **Executors**: Processes running on worker nodes responsible for running tasks and storing data.
4. **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**: Immutable distributed collections of objects that can be processed in parallel.

## Spark Programming Model
Spark uses a high-level programming model based on RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets), which are fault-tolerant collections of objects distributed across the nodes of a cluster. Key operations on RDDs include:
- **Transformation**: Operations like map, filter, and reduce that create new RDDs.
- **Actions**: Operations like collect, count, and save that return results or store data.

## Getting Started with Spark
This section provides setup instructions for running Apache Spark on your local machine or cluster. It includes sample code for basic operations in Spark, such as reading data, applying transformations, and performing actions.
