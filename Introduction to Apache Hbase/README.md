## What is HBase?
Apache HBase is an open-source, column-oriented NoSQL database that runs on top of HDFS, allowing for random, real-time read and write access to large datasets. HBase is especially suited for sparse data sets and supports operations on massive tables with billions of rows and millions of columns.

## Core Features of HBase
- **Column-Oriented Storage**: Organizes data by columns rather than rows, making it highly efficient for certain types of data retrieval.
- **Scalability**: Can scale horizontally across clusters of commodity hardware.
- **Real-Time Access**: Provides real-time read and write capabilities, ideal for applications needing rapid data access.
- **Integration with Hadoop**: Compatible with MapReduce, Hive, and other components in the Hadoop ecosystem.
- **Automatic Sharding**: Distributes data across nodes in the cluster for balanced workloads.

## HBase Architecture
1. **HBase Master**: Manages the HBase cluster, including regions and load balancing.
2. **Region Servers**: Hosts and manages regions, which store subsets of table data.
3. **Regions**: The smallest unit of data storage, containing rows within a table.
4. **Zookeeper**: Coordinates and monitors the health of the HBase cluster.

## Getting Started with HBase
This section provides guidance on setting up HBase, creating tables, inserting data, and performing queries. It includes example commands and basic operations to help beginners get hands-on with HBase.
